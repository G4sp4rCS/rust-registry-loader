# Registry Loader (Rust)

This project demonstrates how to read an encrypted payload from the Windows Registry, decrypt it with RC4, and execute it from memory using Rust and the WinAPI.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:**  
This project is for educational and research purposes only. Running shellcode loaders outside of a controlled lab environment is dangerous and potentially illegal. Use this only in your own lab for learning purposes.

## ü¶Ä Features

- Reads a binary value (`REG_BINARY`) from the Windows Registry:
  - Subkey: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel`
  - Value: `MalDevAcademy`
- Decrypts the value using RC4 with a fixed 16-byte key.
- Allocates executable memory with `VirtualAlloc`.
- Copies the decrypted payload into memory.
- Changes memory protection to executable (`VirtualProtect`).
- Spawns a new thread (`CreateThread`) to execute the payload.
- Waits for the thread to complete with `WaitForSingleObject`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Read Registry Value  
   Uses `RegGetValueA` to fetch the payload stored in the Registry.

2. RC4 Decryption  
   A simple RC4 implementation decrypts the payload with the predefined key:

   ```rust
   const RC4_KEY: [u8; 16] = [0x0E, 0x56, 0x75, 0xA4, ...];
    ```

4. Memory Allocation
The decrypted payload is copied into a buffer allocated with VirtualAlloc.

5. Execution
Memory protections are updated with VirtualProtect, and the shellcode is executed in a new thread with CreateThread.
